    Teamplayer
    I enjoy working solo, but i love beeing part off a team. 
    I love helping and inspiring people, to see them grow and unlock their true pottential.
    It was one of, if not the most, rewarding aspect of my time spent leading a small team in a previous job.

    Problemsolving
    Problems are just puzzels waiting to be solved and I love solving puzzels.
    This is why i enjoy programming so much, it's just one puzzel after the other.

    Innovative
    I enjoy thinking about how things can be better or more efficient.
    I always say "I'm kind off lazy so i like to think about how i can make things easier for myself".
    Don't get me wrong I work hard but if things can get done faster and better with less effort, who doesn't love that.
