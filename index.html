    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm a passionate and motivated beginner developer making an exciting career switch from the logistics industry. 
        After several years working in operations and supply chain, I discovered a strong interest in technology and problem-solving,
        which led me to start learning software development.
      </p>
      
      <p>While I'm at the start of my journey, I'm committed to building solid foundations in front-end and back-end development.
        I have started My Journey on Udemy With the help off Dr. Angela Yu from <a href="https://www.appbrewery.com/">The App Brewery</a>
        and I'm constantly learning through hands-on projects and continuous study.
      </p>
      
      <p>I'm excited to grow as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, 
        and eventually become part of a team that builds innovative digital solutions.
      </p>
